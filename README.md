# kata

code kata for practice.  nothing terribly of interest, just coding problems, data structures and algorithms.

some stuff could be pulled into a library.

- there is a submodule to [ryjen/challenges](https://github.com/ryjen/challenges) for coding interview tests.
- the [c kata](c/src/coda/life/lists/) has a nice lists library
- the [java kata](java) has a nice graphs library

TODO:

[ ] machine learning!
